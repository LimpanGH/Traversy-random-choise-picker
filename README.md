Q.A ----------------------------------------------------- 

* js line 9: How does the eventparameter "(e)" work?
* js line 22:  Why do we need ".map(tag => tag.trim())", we already told it to trim?
* js line 27: What does "('span')"  do?, When I replace it with other text, nothing changes in the application. He later refers to the tags under the textarea as "spans". But I don't get it.
* js: need to review the whole "function randomSelect()"
